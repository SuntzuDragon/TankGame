# TankGame

Made by Ian McBride and Jacob Knowlton with pygame, blood, sweat, and tears (of joy).

# How To Play
The green tank player uses WASD controls to move up, left, down, and right respectively.
The red tank player uses the arrow keys to move.
For green to fire, spacebar is used. For red it is the numpad 0.

# Installation
As long as python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pygame (https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) are installed,
just download and run the "tanks.py" file.
